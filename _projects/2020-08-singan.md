title: "SinGAN: Train a GAN with only a single image"
date: 2020-08-31

This is an implementation of the SinGAN presented in [this
paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.01164). It is a bonus
project I coded with a colleague in PyTorch. It can be
used to train a GAN on just a single image. That GAN can
then perform a bunch of tasks, e.g., super resolution or
image inpainting. This project whips with a Django
frontend ready to be deployed as an interactive webpage.
You can find it on [GitHub](https://github.com/jonasgrebe/pt-singan-single-image-gan).
