As my **Computer Science Bachelor's Thesis**, I investigated
[Sum-Product Networks (SPNs)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1202.3732) using so-called
[Influence Functions](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v70/koh17a/koh17a.pdf). My work contributes to the
understanding of SPNs by showing, e.g., how single
training instances affect the SPN's prediction on other
instances. You can download my thesis [here](assets/documents/thesis_cs_bachelor.pdf). The code is
available on [GitHub](https://github.com/ml-research/Interpreting-SPNs).
