During the COVID-19 Pandemic, a lot of conspiracy theorists
gathered on Telegram in various public groups and channels.
I'm working on a crawler, the task of which is to scan these
chats and analyze the public available information. At the
time of writing (Jan 2022), the crawler collected >20 GB worth of text
messages, 1.75 mio user accounts and >5300 German chats,
the vast majority of which is promoting conspiracy theories.
