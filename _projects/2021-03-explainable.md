title: "Explainable AI: A systematic review to find a unified definition of explainability and interpretability"

A scientific literature analysis I've done with a colleague
for a seminar. Commonly used AI models, especially neural
networks, are hard to explain and to understand. In order
to support trust, explainability of these models is a desired
property. However, there is no unique definition of _explainability_
and _interpretability_. We examined the different definitions
stated in the literature and, based on that, proposed an own
one.
