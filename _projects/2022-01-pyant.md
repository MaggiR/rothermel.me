pyAnt is a Serious Game (SG) prototype, the concept of
which is to build an ant colony where the ants are
controlled only via Python code. I developed that game
together with my team as a project at the SG group. We
implemented the game with the Godot engine and released
it on itch.io [here](https://maggir.itch.io/pyant).
