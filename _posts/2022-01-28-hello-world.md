**A new page is born! This blog is the
first completed feature of my new, Jekyll-generated
web presence.**

`Hello World!` I'm happy to announce my first blog post
on my personal webpage! :D It marks the official
beginning of my new web presence. (And I'm glad the domain
[rothermel.me](https://rothermel.me) was still available!)

## This webpage is generated using Jekyll

My entire homepage is static. I use the static site
generator [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to build this
page. It's my first time to
use a static site generator, but it's not the first time I
designed a webpage. For example, I designed the homepage
of [Matheball](https://matheball.de), the mathematician's
dancing ball at my university.

The setup of Jekyll and Ruby was quite a mess. Fortunately,
you need to do that once, and the rest goes off like a
charm. I found it relatively easy to construct and design
this page. It's even responsive! In fact, the frontpage is
_continuously_ responsive, that is, it adjusts its contents
_smoothly_ to each and every common window size.

(If you watch the dark background closely, you
may notice a slight border
caused by the background image. This is because the image
contains a little noise, but the webpage's background color
doesn't. (I already know a fix for that.))_

Surely, I'm not a master designer, but I'm quite happy with
this page so far. :) The theme I built upon is called "Dark
Poole." I added several Bootstrap 5 elements.

Static sites also have their drawbacks. For example,
interactivity comes very short, i.e., you cannot like
blog posts or write comments (although there are
workarounds for the latter).

However, static sites are easy to maintain, and you don't
need an own server. I use GitHub Pages to host this page.

## Blog posts in English and German

The posts I publish in this blog will be either in English
or in German language, depending on the topic and on the
relevance. For example, posts relating to German politics
will stick to my native language German while
contributions to, e.g.,
Machine Learning will be in English.

By the way, the original format of these blog posts is
Markdown. Jekyll then translates them into the
corresponding HTML file.

## Planned features: Project list and Instagram feed

Right now, only this blog is implemented. More features are
underway, including a list of all my noteworthy
projects, and a page showing my Instagram feed. So far,
so good!
