I built a TensorFlow framework for learning Angry Birds
(and other
games) using basic state-of-the-art Reinforcement
Learning (RL) techniques. One can easily exchange the
AI model and the game environment. This is my largest
project so far and is a continuation of a bonus project
I finished together with three other team members. The
project is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/BluemlJ/AiBirds).
