**2.5+ years went by since the release of this webpage. Here comes not just a visual update.**

_An updated version of myself, almost exactly three years older. I can't believe I managed to match the exact same pose! ü§£_

There is so much to tell! I successfully finished my Master's (see my [Thesis](/assets/documents/thesis_cs_master.pdf)) and began my [Multimodal AI PhD](https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/mai/multimodal_ai/people_mai/teamdetails_136896.en.jsp) last November, so it's almost one year in! We're building a cutting-edge fact-checking system to combat disinformation; we just won 1st place of a global fact-checking challenge! üôÇ

Politics also makes a lot of fun! My most recent political initiative is the introduction of the "Supplementary Vote" (_Ersatzstimme_), see also my new mini wiki [ersatzstimme.wiki](https://ersatzstimme.wiki). Maybe, I'll post a plea for the Ersatzstimme here soon, but time capacity is restricted.

Newly, I was elected to be the board member of the student council's community plus I was re-elected as the chairman of the JuLis Darmstadt and the treasurer of the FDP Darmstadt, so I'm in the board of three organizations now. ‚≠ê

In the next two weeks, I'm going to move within Darmstadt into a brand-new apartment. üè† The journey goes on!
