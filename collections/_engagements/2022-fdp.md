I consider myself liberal. For this reason, I engage in the
German liberal party, the Free Democratic Party (FDP).
Currently, I am
[board member](https://fdp-darmstadt.de/person/mark-rothermel/)
of the local FDP division in
Darmstadt. During the election campaign for the general
elections in Germany in 2021, I engaged a lot. For example, I...
* organized the party's entire presence on the Darmstadt
Gay Pride,
* designed and ordered tens of thousands of flyers
and mobilized the people to distribute them, and
* managed social media, made photoshootings, hang election
  posters, debated with people in the streets, and so on...
