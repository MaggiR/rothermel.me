  alt: Me leading an orientation week
---

For many years I volunteered for the CS student council, which calls itself "D120". Things I've done there:
* Leading the CS orientation week organization team
* Managing the council's treasure for five years
* Organizing several annual student events such as the CS summer festival or the mathematician's dancing ball ["Matheball"](https://matheball.de){:target="_blank"}.

See my personal page [there](https://d120.de/de/fachschaft/fachschaftler_innen/mark-rothermel/){:target="_blank"} for more details.
