For many years now I volunteer for the CS student council,
which calls itself "D120".
Most of my voluntary work went into this awesome community.

Things I've done there:
* I was the head leader of the CS orientation week
  organization team once and team member many times.
* I'm the treasurer, managing the council's finance.
* Moreover, I was the main organizer of many annual student
  events such as the summer festival and the mathematician's
  dancing ball ["Matheball"](https://matheball.de).
