Queer people in Germany, although benefiting from numerous
improvements in the last years, are still underrepresented
and discriminated against.
This is why I am an active member of vielbunt e. V.

vielbunt does important work for the queer community,
including the fight for queer rights and bringing LGBT
people together. As an instance, vielbunt organizes the
annual [Darmstadt Gay Pride](https://www.csd-darmstadt.de/2021/08/csd-2022-am-20-august/){:target="_blank"}.
vielbunt is one of most professional
organized charitable communities I've ever seen.

Here, I am...
* co-leading the organization of the annual queer
  open-air cinema,
* participating in several other working groups dealing
  with the organization of the next gay pride event,
* helping out ad hoc in several community events such as
  parties, and
* doing many other things like filming the vielbunt Christmas
  show, helping to plan and renovate the community's premises,
  going on demonstrations etc.
